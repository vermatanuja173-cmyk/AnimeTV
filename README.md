## What zxkai includes

- **Recent-release home screen** with a daily carousel, high-resolution artwork, blur-until-ready loading, and fast manual navigation.
- **Smart anime search** with typo tolerance, alternate-title matching, franchise grouping, and natural ordering so original seasons appear before sequels.
- **Rich title pages** with stable posters and backdrops, complete descriptions, English and Spanish text, expandable summaries, seasons, episode names, dates, and thumbnails.
- **Long-series support** with predictable episode filtering and navigation for catalogs such as Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach.
- **Latest episode routing** that opens the newest available episode in context without autoplaying it.
- **Multi-source playback** with HLS, direct video, and embed support. AnimeAV1 is preferred when available, with provider fallbacks preserved when it is not.
- **Google Cast controls** with receiver-compatible source selection, duplicate-device protection, and an explicit stop-casting action.
- **Responsive playback** for desktop, portrait phones, tablets, and TV, including compact episode titles and fullscreen behavior.
- **Personal library** with animated favorite feedback, resilient favorite storage, continue watching, history, and resume positions.
- **Weekly schedule** with stable Monday-to-Sunday sections, local-time airings, and 12-hour clock formatting.
- **Isolated adult mode** with its own catalog, releases, artwork pipeline, favorites, and a persistent random-title control.
- **Installable clients** as a PWA, Android mobile/tablet APK, and Android TV APK from the same codebase.

## Performance and reliability

ZenkaiTV is designed to avoid scaling upstream traffic one-to-one with visitors:

- Vercel CDN caching and stale-while-revalidate for shared catalog and metadata routes.
- In-flight request coalescing for identical upstream work.
- Bounded timeouts, rate-limit handling, and stale fallbacks instead of aggressive retries.
- A compact homepage bootstrap followed by deferred catalog enrichment.
- Lazy metadata and artwork hydration so navigation stays responsive.
- Versioned static assets and a service worker for reliable updates.
- Stable image selection so cards and carousel slides do not swap artwork after rendering.

The implementation and route-by-route decisions are documented in the [Vercel Function audit](docs/vercel-function-audit.md).

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client[Web / PWA / Android clients] --> CDN[Vercel CDN]
    CDN --> Static[Versioned static application]
    CDN --> API[Node API function]
    API --> Metadata[AniList / Jikan / TMDB]
    API --> Providers[Configured catalog and playback providers]
    API --> Cache[Memory cache and request coalescing]
```

The frontend is framework-free JavaScript and CSS. The same Node handler runs locally and through the Vercel catch-all adapter. Shared metadata is cacheable at the edge, while short-lived media URLs remain narrowly cached so playback and Cast behavior stay correct.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node.js 20.9 or newer and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JSolanoDev/AnimeTV.git
cd AnimeTV
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173). Optional API keys and provider bridges are documented in [.env.example](.env.example); the catalog UI can still start when optional providers are unavailable.

On Windows, use `Copy-Item .env.example .env.local` in place of `cp`.

## Validation

```bash
npm run check
npm test
npm run vercel-build
```

GitHub Actions runs the static checks, regression suite, lint rules, adult release checks, and production build for every pull request and push to `main`.

## Android builds

With the Android SDK and a compatible JDK installed:

```powershell
npm run android:build
```

| Target | APK |
| --- | --- |
| Phone and tablet | `android/app/build/outputs/apk/mobile/debug/app-mobile-debug.apk` |
| Android TV | `android/app/build/outputs/apk/tv/debug/app-tv-debug.apk` |

See [Android mobile and TV setup](docs/ANDROID_TV.md) for ADB installation and device notes.

## Deployment

The production site is deployed on Vercel. The repository already includes the static build, catch-all API adapter, CDN headers, security headers, and SPA rewrites required by the app.

```bash
npm run vercel-build
```

See the [deployment guide](docs/DEPLOY.md) for Vercel configuration, optional environment variables, cache verification, and self-hosting.
